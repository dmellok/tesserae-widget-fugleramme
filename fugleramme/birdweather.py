"""Public BirdWeather stations as the frame's detection source.

BirdWeather serves every station through one GraphQL endpoint, so the frame names
a station by its page, `https://app.birdweather.com/stations/<id>`, and posts its
questions to `/graphql` on the same host. Several stations are asked as one, by
`stationIds`, so a species heard at more than one is one bird:

    station                -> one station's name and its first and last detection
    detections             -> the newest detections, newest first
    topSpecies             -> per-species counts over a rolling window
    dailyDetectionCounts   -> per-species counts per UTC day, the whole record
    allSpecies             -> a species' names in every language BirdWeather has
    stations               -> the stations in a box, for the admin's search

It is someone else's service, shared by every frame reading the same station and
asked every few seconds, and a POST gets no working ETag. So an answer is held
about a minute, and the whole record is fetched a few times a day with only its
last two days asked again each minute.
